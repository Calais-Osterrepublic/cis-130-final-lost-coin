                    return, so I phoned Lynette. She responded quickly, and resolved the issues in a matter of days. She
                    took the time to educate me on how to set up systems and processes to keep my business on track"

                <blockquote>
                    "We started getting threatening letters from the IRS for prior year tax returns that we did not
                    realize we needed to file as we had been out of the country. Then we discovered significant mistakes
                    on more recently filed returns made by another tax preparer. We hired Lynette to assist us in
                    resolving our IRS problems. She keeps us updated regularly, and she is knowledgeable and detailed in
                    her work. She is also helping us get our business records more organized so we can keep this from
                    happening again. What a huge relief!"

                    went to work on it and was able to get the IRS adjustments corrected and my full refund returned to
                    me. She was tenacious and persistent and did not relent until the issue was resolved."
