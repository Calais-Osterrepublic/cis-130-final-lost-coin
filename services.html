      <h2>Tax Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        For most people, dealing with the IRS isn’t fun or easy. And when you get audited, it can be overwhelming. You

        handle it either! We’ve got you covered – we’re a local company that provides personalized tax resolution
        service at a fraction of the cost of those large national tax firms. Our team has decades of experience helping
        taxpayers just like you resolve their issues quickly and easily!

      <h2>Forensic Accounting</h2>
      <p>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations lose at least 5% of their revenues to
        fraud each year. So, if your business is bringing in $1 million in annual revenues, you could be losing $50,000
        of those hard-earned dollars to occupational fraud – fraud committed by employees against their employers. All
        fraud is committed by a person in a position of trust.</p>
